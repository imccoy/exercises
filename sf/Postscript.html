<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Large-scale applications of these core topics can be found
    everywhere, both in ongoing research projects and in real-world
    software systems.  Here are a few recent examples involving
    formal, machine-checked verification of real-world software and
    hardware systems, to give a sense of what is being done
    today... 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab947"></a><h3 class="section">CompCert</h3>
 <i>CompCert</i> is a fully verified optimizing compiler for almost all
    of the ISO C<sub>90</sub> / ANSI C language, generating code for x<sub>86</sub>, ARM,
    and PowerPC processors.  The whole of CompCert is is written in
    Gallina and extracted to an efficient OCaml program using Coq's
    extraction facilities.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "The CompCert project investigates the formal verification of
    realistic compilers usable for critical embedded software. Such
    verified compilers come with a mathematical, machine-checked proof
    that the generated executable code behaves exactly as prescribed
    by the semantics of the source program. By ruling out the
    possibility of compiler-introduced bugs, verified compilers
    strengthen the guarantees that can be obtained by applying formal
    methods to source programs."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In 2011, CompCert was included in a landmark study on fuzz-testing
    a large number of real-world C compilers using the CSmith tool.
    The CSmith authors wrote:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the
        middle-end bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As
        of early 2011, the under-development version of CompCert is
        the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot find
        wrong-code errors. This is not for lack of trying: we have
        devoted about six CPU-years to the task. The apparent
        unbreakability of CompCert supports a strong argument that
        developing compiler optimizations within a proof framework,
        where safety checks are explicit and machine-checked, has
        tangible benefits for compiler users.

</li>
</ul>

<a name="lab948"></a><h3 class="section">seL4</h3>
 <i>seL4</i> is a fully verified microkernel, considered to be the
    world's first OS kernel with an end-to-end proof of implementation
    correctness and security enforcement.  It is implemented in C and
    ARM assembly and specified and verified using Isabelle.  The code
    is available as open source.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "seL4 has been comprehensively formally verified: a rigorous
    process to prove mathematically that its executable code, as it
    runs on hardware, correctly implements the behaviour allowed by
    the specification, and no others. Furthermore, we have proved that
    the specification has the desired safety and security
    properties (integrity and confidentiality)... The verification was
    achieved at a cost that is significantly less than that of
    traditional high-assurance development approaches, while giving
    guarantees traditional approaches cannot provide."

<a name="lab949"></a><h3 class="section">CertiKOS</h3>
 <i>CertiKOS</i> is a clean-slate, fully verified hypervisor, written in
    CompCert C and verified in Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "The CertiKOS project aims to develop a novel and practical
    programming infrastructure for constructing large-scale certified
    system software. By combining recent advances in programming
    languages, operating systems, and formal methods, we hope to
    attack the following research questions: (1) what OS kernel
    structure can offer the best support for extensibility, security,
    and resilience? (2) which semantic models and program logics can
    best capture these abstractions? (3) what are the right
    programming languages and environments for developing such
    certified kernels? and (4) how to build automation facilities to
    make certified software development really scale?"

<a name="lab950"></a><h3 class="section">Ironclad</h3>
 <i>Ironclad Apps</i> is a collection of fully verified web
    applications, including a "notary" for securely signing
    statements, a password hasher, a multi-user trusted counter, and a
    differentially-private database.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The system is coded in the verification-oriented programming
    language Dafny and verified using Boogie, a verification tool
    based on Hoare logic.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "An Ironclad App lets a user securely transmit her data to a
    remote machine with the guarantee that every instruction executed
    on that machine adheres to a formal abstract specification of the
    appâ€™s behavior. This does more than eliminate implementation
    vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, parsing errors, or data
    leaks; it tells the user exactly how the app will behave at all
    times. We provide these guarantees via complete, low-level
    software verification. We then use cryptography and secure
    hardware to enable secure channels from the verified software to
    remote users."

<a name="lab951"></a><h3 class="section">Verdi</h3>
 <i>Verdi</i> is a framework for implementing and formally verifying
    distributed systems.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "Verdi supports several different fault models ranging from
    idealistic to realistic. Verdi's verified system
    transformers (VSTs) encapsulate common fault tolerance
    techniques. Developers can verify an application in an idealized
    fault model, and then apply a VST to obtain an application that is
    guaranteed to have analogous properties in a more adversarial
    environment.  Verdi is developed using the Coq proof assistant,
    and systems are extracted to OCaml for execution. Verdi systems,
    including a fault-tolerant key-value store, achieve comparable
    performance to unverified counterparts."

<a name="lab952"></a><h3 class="section">DeepSpec</h3>
 <i>The Science of Deep Specification</i> is an NSF "Expedition"
    project (running from 2016 to 2020) that focuses on the
    specification and verification of full functional correctness of
    both software and hardware.  It also sponsors workshops and summer
    schools.

<a name="lab953"></a><h3 class="section">REMS</h3>
 <i>REMS</i> is a european project on Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream
    Systems.  It has produced detailed formal specifications of a wide
    range of critical real-world interfaces, protocols, and APIs,
    including 
      the C language, 
      the ELF linker format,
      the ARM, Power, MIPS, CHERI, and RISC-V instruction sets,
      the weak memory models of ARM and Power processors, and
      POSIX filesystems.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    "The project is focussed on lightweight rigorous methods: precise
    specification (post hoc and during design) and testing against
    specifications, with full verification only in some cases. The
    project emphasises building useful (and reusable) semantics and
    tools. We are building accurate full-scale mathematical models of
    some of the key computational abstractions (processor
    architectures, programming languages, concurrent OS interfaces,
    and network protocols), studying how this can be done, and
    investigating how such models can be used for new verification
    research and in new systems and programming language
    research. Supporting all this, we are also working on new
    specification tools and their foundations."
